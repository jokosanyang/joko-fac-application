    <div id="Start">    
        <h2>"This is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down."</h2>
        <p> Once upon a time, a girl was born in Malmo, Sweden to Gambian parents. She grew up an only child, and on days where she was not playing outside in the forests and hills near their apartment, her George of the Jungle VHS tape, her Nintendo, and channel 8 (MTV) were her faithful companions. <br>
        She enjoyed her small town life until the age of 10, when she and her mother packed their bags and flew over the North Sea to start a new life in the big city of London, England. <br>
        Not yet enrolled in school, she took a summer crash course in English, taught by the experts: the Lorelai Gilmores, Lizzie McGuire, and the cast of EastEnders. She devoured every book she could get her hands on, with dreams of hitting her 100 books in a year target <span class="highlight">(the record remains at 93)</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Middle">
        <h2>“What do you want to be when you grow up?”</h2>
        <p> As she grew up, the girl flipped through career options as if they were Netflix movie suggestions. One day, she would be certain she wanted to spend her life taking pictures and writing articles for magazines, the next, convinced she would be the perfect truck driver/candy delivery person. <br>
        Weeks before the university application deadline, she finally landed on a choice. Pharmacy. It combined her love of science and desire to directly help people in the community. Five years of dedicated study later, she registered as a pharmacist and started working straight away. <br>
        It was fulfilling for a while, but after a year of hitting prescription items targets, giving elderly patients their annual flu vaccinations, and selling over-the-counter medicines, she began to feel like something was missing. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Later">
        <h2>"You can't sit with us."</h2>
        <p>Encouraged by friends, she explored alternate paths. Over dinner one night, one of her friends told her of a magical training course he had attended that he believed would be the perfect fit for her. <span class="highlight">Founders and Coders</span>. <br>
        She had always thought of tech as an interesting field, but surely not for her? Developer jobs were for the cool people, the guys who built their first computer at the age of nine. She had never seen a black Muslim lady in the ads, in the TV shows, or in any IT department. <br>
        She pondered for a while, but decided the underrepresentation just gave her more reason to go for it. She may not even have built her first website yet, but she had the determination to learn how to. She began to dream of the little girl seeing her in her office in the future and feeling like it was an option for her too. <br>
        Though intrigued by the world of technology, she was torn. Was she going to throw away the five years she spent conquering the concepts of neurotransmitter pathways, polymerase chain reactions, and pharmaceutics? <br> 
        One day, she spoke to a computer science veteran (read: PhD student) who enlightened her to something painfully obvious. <span class="highlight"> New skills do not overwrite existing ones.</span> She did not have to abandon her medicines knowledge. She could combine them! 
        </p>
    </div>
       <div id="Future">
        <h2>“Where do we go from here?”</h2>
        <p>She resigned from her job and decided to focus her efforts on realising her tech ambitions, dedicating her time to completing the Founders and Coders prerequisites, as well as exploring any other interesting topics that appeared on her journey. She was stunned at how straight-forward HTML was, how flexible CSS was, and how powerful Javascript could be. As she picked up the basic skills and delved into Codewars, <span class="highlight">she knew she was hooked</span>.<br> 
        In the future, she hopes to further develop her newfound tech knowledge and combine her skills into a product or business that can improve access to healthcare for those who are currently underserved. <br> 
        For now, on days off, she can usually be found wearing headphones to escape silence, baking cookies to share with unsuspecting neighbours, or making plans to <span class="highlight">actually</span> play badminton at some point.
